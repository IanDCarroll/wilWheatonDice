# wilWheatonDice
Wil Wheaton Dice is a Random number generator/ data anylizer for those that are afflicted or have come in contact with the Wheaton Dice Curse.

In the interest of science, we must study this probablility-breaking phenomenon so as to better understand the curse, its cause, its scope, and ultimately its nature. Is it an invisible demon? Is it limited to physical dice? Or is it some cosmic balancing act for all the times kittens should be killed crossing the street, but are spared? Only science can tell, and this instrument will be the sensor we use to learn more of this sinister occurrence.

Function:

1. The program should have input as a random number generator which mimics dice rolls as they exist in table-top roleplaying games. It should have functionality as to be useful to a Table Top RPG Player or GM.

2. The program should also have a method of storing manually data from physical dice rolls.

3. This input should (a.) be stored in data, and (b.) be displayed in a series of charts and (c.) compare the rolls to what probability would expect.

More as developments support and improve these basic functions.
