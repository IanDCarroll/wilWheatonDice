# Let's try Python because numbers, science and Pyhton are friends.
# Research which Libraries would be most suitable for the task of physics.
# NumPy? SciPy? 
# Or do these libraries fail to customize to the level we're looking for.
# Should instead the algorythm ultimately be in C or C++ for speed?
# Or can we use PyPy to get it to acceptible levels?
